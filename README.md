Cyclic learning rate: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf

It is known that the learning rate is the most important hyper-parameter to tune for training deep neural networks. This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally Ô¨Ånd the best values and schedule for the global learning rates.
