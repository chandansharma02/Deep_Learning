# Exercise 1: Regularization & Metrics

1. In `session/11_cnn_timeseries_sales.ipynb`, add `dropout` layers and try `weight_decay` in the optimizer.
2. Train for a few settings (e.g., dropout 0.2 vs 0.5, weight_decay 0 vs 1e-4).
3. Compare **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **RÂ²** on the validation set.
4. Report the best configuration and a 1-paragraph rationale.
