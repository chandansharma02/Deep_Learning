# Exercise 2: Feature Ablation

1. Using either CNN or LSTM model, remove **one** interaction feature at a time:
   - `rep_calls_4w`
   - `emails_4w`
   - `samples_4w`
   - `events_12w`
2. Retrain quickly and record validation MAE.
3. Which feature hurts performance the most when removed? Write a brief commercial implication.
